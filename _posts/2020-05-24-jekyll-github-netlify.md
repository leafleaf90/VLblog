## Smooth hosting

This blog is using the static site generator Jekyll (see [last post]({% post_url 2020-05-20-generating-the-blog-with-jekyll %})). With Netlify, you can push changes to a GitHub repository and Netlify takes it from there, including the build process. See step-by-step-instructions [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/02/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-4.0-on-netlify/).

It is smooth and simple this way. Build time is a few minutes.
