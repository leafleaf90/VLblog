To see how to quickly get up and running with Nuxt and Tailwind, the post on that [here]({% post_url 2024-01-10-nuxt-tailwind-quick-start %}).

On top of Tailwind CSS, I like to use a component library to further speed up the front-end development in Nuxt (works with other Javascript frameworks as well). Right now, I prefer [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/){:target="\_blank"} as it goes very well together with Tailwind and is relatively minimal. The benefit of using a component library is that you get a lot of components that are ready to be used instantly.

Install DaisyUI
[Docs here](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/){:target="\_blank"}

```
npm i -D daisyui@latest
```

Then add the plugin to Tailwind (if you don’t already have a Tailwind config file, create it manually or run _"npx tailwindcss init --ts"_ in the terminal).

This is how your Tailwind config file should look after you’ve added the plugin:

```
//tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

export default {
  content: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require("daisyui")],
} satisfies Config
```

You’ll need to restart the dev environment to see the changes.

If you’re having issues, you can see the Nuxt example repository here:
[Stackblitz Nuxt+DaisyUI repository](https://stackblitz.com/edit/daisyui-nuxt3/?file=package.json){:target="\_blank"}.

Now you can go ahead and use the components. For example, say you want a nice spinner/loader while you’re fetching data:

<img class="half-image" src="/assets/post-media/2024-01-10_2/search_bar_passive.png"/>

<img class="half-image" src="/assets/post-media/2024-01-10_2/search_bar_active.png"/>

It's as easy as using the spinner component:

```
<span class="loading loading-spinner loading-lg" v-if="searching"></span>
```

_(if you want to see how to use icons such as the magnifying glass easily in your project, see the bottom of this post)_

Another convenient module is the modal:

<img  src="/assets/post-media/2024-01-10_2/modal.png"/>

To explore all components, see:
[DaisyUI Components](https://daisyui.com/components/){:target="\_blank"}

To further supercharge your front-end development, you can go ahead and add the Nuxt Icon module which let's you use thousands of icons from within your code editor.
[Nuxt Icon](https://nuxt.com/modules/icon){:target="\_blank"}

```
pnpm install --save-dev nuxt-icon
```

```
//nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  devtools: { enabled: true },
  modules: ["@nuxtjs/tailwindcss", "nuxt-icon"],
});
```

Now you can choose any icons from here:
https://icones.js.org/

If you use the [VS Code Iconify IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.iconify){:target="\_blank"} extension you will see the icon within the editor.

To use the magnifying icon used earlier in this post, for example:

```
<Icon v-if="!searching" size="2em" name="mdi:book-search-outline" />
```
